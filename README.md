# ARNN - Master SII

This repository contains the work for the ARNN (Artificial Neural Networks and Neural Networks) module in the Master SII program. The project is structured into several TPs (Travaux Pratiques) where each TP covers a different concept related to neural networks, including performance evaluation, gradient descent, multi-class classification, and backpropagation algorithms.

## Repository Structure

- **TP1: Mesures de performances**
  - In this TP, performance metrics are measured and analyzed.

- **TP2: Descente du gradient**
  - This TP includes the implementation of gradient descent from scratch, and it compares this implementation with the one provided in sklearn. It also involves linear regression with multiple variables.

- **TP4: Réseaux de neurones - Multi classification et Propagation en avant**
  - In TP4, a multi-class classification task is tackled. The comparison is made between logistic regression and neural network-based classification using forward propagation. The dataset used is the same as in TP1 (digit images).

- **TP5: Réseaux de neurones - Multi classification et Propagation en arrière**
  - TP5 focuses on training a neural network for classification using the backpropagation algorithm. The dataset remains the same as TP1.

- **TP6: Réseaux de neurones - Multi classification et Propagation en arrière**
  - TP6 continues the multi-class classification task using the backpropagation algorithm with the same dataset as in previous TPs.

## Datasets
The datasets for all TPs are included in their respective folders. These datasets are used throughout the project for training and testing the models.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks and code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for neural networks)

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
